# MisaHub.Project
This project presents a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed for multi-class classification of gastrointestinal (GI) anomalies in video capsule endoscopy (VCE) images. The model is built with five convolutional blocks, each containing two convolutional layers with progressively larger filter sizes (from 32 to 512), allowing it to capture increasingly complex features. Max-pooling layers follow each block to retain critical image details while reducing spatial dimensions. Dropout layers are incorporated to prevent overfitting, and a fully connected dense layer refines high-level features before the output layer classifies images into 10 GI classes (e.g., bleeding, polyp, erosion). The model uses the Adam optimizer with categorical cross-entropy loss, achieving a high accuracy on GI classification tasks and demonstrating its potential as an AI-driven diagnostic tool.
